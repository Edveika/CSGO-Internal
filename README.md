## üõë NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Since CS2 is already released this hack is out of date and although some parts could maybe be reused, will not receive any updates, instead I might make CS2 Internal.

## üíâ CSGO Internal

This is my first hack for a Source engine game - CSGO. It was made for Windows version of the game and serves a learning purpose.
